# Compiling #

I left the hex file (wii2usb.hex) in the Release folder for uploading.
For compiling, need to have programs/utilities to compile avr projects. (i.e. WINAVR, AVR-libc gcc)


# Details #
I there are 2 Makefiles, one in the root folder and one in "Release". The one in the Release folder was autogenerated using Eclipse IDE (it generates the binary files within the Release folder).  The one in the root folder was made by hand. Can use either one.  I thought some people might have problems with the autogenerated one, so I included a static one.  Eclipse users might want to import the project and use the one in the "Release" folder.

(sorry I cannot provide much help, I am not very knowledgeable about compiling. Its my first time releasing C code and sort of trail and error for me.)
